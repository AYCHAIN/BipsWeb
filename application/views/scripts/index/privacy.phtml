The bip.io Privacy Policy was updated on April 17, 2015 and is effective as of this date (the “Effective Date”). If your first use of the Service (as defined below) occurred on or after the Effective Date, the updated Privacy Policy applies to all information that we collect about you. If your first use of the Service occurred prior to the Effective Date, the updated Privacy Policy does not retroactively apply to any information that we have collected about you prior to the Effective  Date, unless and until you opt-in to the updated Privacy Policy.  You can opt-in to the updated Privacy Policy by reviewing and accepting the following opt-in notice upon login.

WOT.IO, Inc. (“WOT.IO,” “we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy and the treatment of your personal information very seriously. This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) describes what information we might collect about a registered user or visitor (“you”) of our bip.io service located at https://bip.io (the “Service”).  Any information we collect about you while you use the Service will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the bip.io Terms of Service located at https://bip.io/terms-of-service or this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.

To make such a request, please use the contact information set forth in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.

<h3>Information Collected from Minors</h3>
<p>
You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to use the Service and children between the ages of thirteen (13) and seventeen (17) may not use the Service without the consent of a parent or guardian.

Accordingly, the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act do not apply to the Service.
</p>
<h3>External Data Storage Sites</h3>
<p>
Your personal information will generally be stored on servers hosted by third party service providers with whom we have contracted.  Your personal information will be granted the protections and will be subject to the security procedures utilized by each such service provider, whose data protection and privacy protections may not afford the same level of protection as required by the laws of certain countries such as the member nations of the European Union. If you wish to receive information about such third party service providers, you may make such a request by using the contact information set forth in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy, including the phrase “Third Party Service Providers” in the subject line, and providing us with your name, address and e-mail address. We will respond to you within thirty (30) days of receiving such a request.
</p>
<h3>Information We Gather Automatically</h3>
<p>
Browsing the bip.io website does not require you to register for a bip.io account (“Account”) or provide us with any personal information. In general, the Service will gather some generic information automatically. This generic information may include the internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the bip.io website, the URL that you just came from and which URL you go to next (regardless of whether these URLs are on the bip.io website), and your computer browser information.  Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor.  This type of aggregate data may enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service, help us determine customer service and bip.io website needs, and do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.  We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Service.
</p>
<h3>Information You Provide</h3>
<p>
We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your questions or requests, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new Service features.
</p>
<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
<p>
We use various technologies to collect and store non-personal information when you use the Service.  We may use cookies to store a unique Session ID to your computer and/or your mobile device for the purpose of session persistence.  Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  You can remove certain cookies by following the directions in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of the Service.
</p>
<p>
We may also send anonymous identifiers to your device, including web beacons, clear GIFs and pixel tags.  Pixel tags are not visible to the user of a website and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the web pages accessed.
</p>
<h3>Logs and Attachments</h3>
<p>
Access logs are gathered and archived automatically for billing audit and error recovery purposes of the Service server software. We do not store personally identifying messages or correspondence within these logs beyond what is minimally required to identify and recover from errors in a live or production environment. Unless a channel with permanent storage is configured by you, message payloads or attachments, such as documents, images, or media, which require automation and processing, may be stored on our systems in an encrypted format for up to three (3) days as part of the Service software’s normal operation.
</p>
<h3>Proper Use and Storage of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
We will use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which such information was collected or subsequently authorized by you.  This also means that we will not use external services you have configured in the system as a vehicle for any bip.io system, company or marketing messaging. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
</p>
<p>
The personal information that you provide and that we collect will be stored and maintained by us for as long as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate (a) to carry out the purpose(s) and the use(s) for which such information was collected or (b) to comply with applicable laws, contracts, or other rules or regulations.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
We will not sell your personal information to, or share or trade your personal information with, any third party except in the following circumstances:
Sharing with your consent – We may share your personal information with any individuals or entities when we have your consent to do so.
Sharing with our affiliates – We may disclose your personal information to our affiliates.
Sharing with authorized third party service providers – You, at your discretion, may elect to purchase from us one or more third party services to be fulfilled by our authorized partners (each a “WOT.IO Partner”). For each such service that you purchase, we may disclose your personal information to the WOT.IO Partner for the purpose of providing the applicable service. Use of a service provided by a WOT.IO Partner is subject to each such WOT.IO Partner’s privacy policy and terms of use for the applicable service.
</p>
<p>
Sharing in connection with business transfers – In the event that we are involved in a transaction such as a merger, stock purchase, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to the other party in such a transaction. You will be notified via e-mail of any change in ownership (other than where the new owners are our affiliates) or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
Sharing as required by law or for the protection of rights – We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, and e-mail address. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena or court order, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss.
</p>
<h3>Communications; Choice and Opt Out Preference</h3>
<p>
When you enter your contact information or send an e-mail or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries and respond to your requests. To the extent your e-mail address is provided to us, you may receive e-mail or other communications from us. If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Service, we may collect such information and store it in a file specific to you. You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you as provided herein, though our intent is that e-mail is the only channel we will use to contact you without your consent.
</p>
<p>
If, at any time, you prefer not to receive further e-mail communications from us, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from all or some of such communications by updating your preferences in your Account or by contacting us at the e-mail address in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. If, at any time, you prefer not to receive any other form of communication from us, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from such communications by contacting us at the e-mail address in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>
We conduct compliance audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy.  Any employee that we determine is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or a message you send to another user of the Service may be used in ways unintended by you.
</p>
<p>
You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and your Account by signing off once you have finished using it on a shared computer. You are responsible for all actions taken with your username, password or application programming interface token (“API token”)   (collectively, “Credentials”). Therefore, we recommend that you do not disclose your Credentials to any third parties. If you choose to share your Credentials or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your Account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy. If you lose control of your password or API token, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password or API token has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password and API token. Should we identify a compromise, your password and API token may be changed automatically either for you as an individual or as part of a batch automation process, and you will be personally notified accordingly.
<p>
We accept no liability for any loss of or unauthorized access to your personal information that results from a breach that is beyond our control.
</p>
<h3>Your Privacy Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
To help protect your privacy, be sure to:
Never share your Credentials with anyone.
Never respond to an e-mail or other type of correspondence from the Service or WOT.IO or anyone claiming to be from the Service or WOT.IO requesting your password or personal information. This includes any message which appears to originate from the Service or WOT.IO domain names.
Never expose API tokens allocated to you in Internet or public environments such as websites, developer tools or third party source code repositories.
Take precautionary measures to guard against malware, for example, by installing and updating anti-virus software and security updates.
Avoid sending sensitive personal information across the Service such as your credit card or banking information or your social security number (for U.S. customers).
</p>
<h3>Information Security; Access Outside the United States</h3>
<p>
Please note that in the event of a security breach, the servers containing your information will become accessible. Also, transmissions via the Internet and mobile networks are never completely private or secure. You understand that any messages or information you send to the Service may be read or intercepted by others.
</p>
<p>
The Service utilizes industry standard 256-bit SSL encryption for all inbound HTTP communications, which includes user subdomains. When visiting the bip.io website from a browser, you should always see a green ‘https’ in the address bar, indicating the page content has been enclosed in a security layer. If this is not the case, we kindly request to be notified immediately. The Service communicates with multiple third party services to which you have subscribed, often negotiating a temporary access token, username/password pair or other kind of credential to establish a communication channel. Credentials you provide or the system negotiates are stored using Advanced Encryption Standard (“AES”). Personal profile information that the Service gathers automatically via an OAuth negotiation or similar are also stored encrypted using AES.  We do not store credit card data as part of our normal operation.]
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about the security of personal information that we collect, please contact us at the e-mail address set forth in the Contact Us section below.
</p>
<p>
We make no claims that the Service or any of its content is appropriate or may be downloaded or accessed outside of the United States. If you access the Service from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of the country in which you access the Service. You may not use or export any content of the Service in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

<h3>Access to Your Personal information</h3>
<p>
We attempt to keep your files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We tell you how and where to conveniently access your personal information, including personal information in your Account, and how to notify us about errors. We offer several ways for you to access and/or update your personal information:
</p>
<p>
You may use the contact information set forth in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy to contact us for any inquiry or request regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
You also may write to us directly if you wish to: (a) update or delete your personal information; (b) close your Account; or (c) request that we cease sending you promotional or other information via mail or e-mail. Such written requests should be sent to us at the e-mail address in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. We will comply with requests for the deletion of personal information subject to the provisions of Section 16 below.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to deny you access to personal information in your Account (a) when such denial of access is required by law; (b) when granting you access is reasonably likely to negatively impact other people’s privacy; (c) to protect our rights and property; and (d) when such requests are frivolous or made in bad faith.
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>
If you wish to cancel your Account or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you services, contact us at the e-mail address in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Do Not Track</h3>
<p>
We do not support Do Not Track (“DNT”)  with respect to your usage of the Service. The Service does not have a mechanism to recognize the various web browser DNT signals, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT-browsed technology and the implementation of a standard.
</p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
You agree that we may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any material modifications to this Privacy Policy and will seek your consent to the extent required by law. Any modification is effective immediately upon posting on <a href="/privacy">This Privacy Policy</a>. Your continued use of the Service following modification of this Privacy Policy will be conclusively deemed to signify your acceptance of the modification.
</p>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>
We welcome questions and comments about this Privacy Policy and/or our use of your information. Questions or comments should be directed to <a href="mailto:support@bip.io">support@bip.io</a>.
